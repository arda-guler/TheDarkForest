# The Dark Forest
A puzzle video game based on the Dark Forest hypothesis, inspired from a certain excerpt by Cixin Liu's famous sci-fi novel series "Remembrance of Earth's Past" a.k.a. Three Body Problem.

## Gameplay
### Controls
**Arrow keys:** Move spaceship

**X:** Gather sector resources

**Z:** Shoot photoid

### Mechanics
You are commanding a Clarketech starship belonging to a very advanced civilization. Your task it to search across your assigned portion of the galaxy and make sure no civilizations that may pose a threat to you in the future can flourish.

You start in top left of the map. Move onto the star systems to explore them.

**White stars:** Unexplored systems

**Yellow stars:** System with no life

**Green stars:** System with basic life forms

**Magenta stars:** Systems with civilizations

Movement takes energy from your ship's energy banks. To generate energy, move onto a star system and press X to gather materials and generate energy. A star system can only be used once to generate energy.

Once you find a star system which harbors civilizations, turn your ship to face the system and shoot a photoid using Z. The photoid will travel through space once every turn and will destroy any life in the star system it hits. However, it takes a significant energy to shoot a photoid.

Some civilizations prefer trying to remain hidden, but some are expansionists. Star systems with lots of activity may be detected from afar. Be careful however! If you travel into a star system with expansionist civilizations in them, you will be attacked and your energy will be drained!

If you run out of energy, you lose the game.

You will win the game once you explore all star systems and there are no civilizations left in your part of the galaxy.
